# hello-world
My first repository, made for the 'What is GitHub?' tutorial

Hello GitHub, I'm Forstrei (or at least, that's what I want to be called on here).
I'm a big fan of Python -despite the popular dislike-, and I'm always willing to learn new languages. I currently know HTML, Python, CSS, and small amounts of C++ and Swift. I'm learning about Swift and XCode right now, so hopefully I'll learn to love it like I love Python (or maybe I'll learn why people dislike python). After that I'll learn Kotlin, and hopefully use my knowledge of both to take the app world by storm! Well, that's the dream. First things first though, let's learn GitHub!
